## TL;DR

- This article talks about using the red-green-refactor method to practice test-driven development.
- It uses a real world example using React with Typescript is shown using an anagram generator challenge.

To lean more about TDD with the red-green-refactor method in a group setting, [see my previous article on the subject](https://timothycurchod.com/writings/red-green-refactor-repeat-dojo).

## React TDD Anagram example

One of the most basic coding challenges is the anagram generator.

Inspired by the [Cyber-dojo site](https://cyber-dojo.org/), the task looks like this:

Write a program to generate all potential anagrams of an input string.

For example, the potential anagrams of "biro" are

```txt
biro bior brio broi boir bori
ibro ibor irbo irob iobr iorb
rbio rboi ribo riob roib robi
obir obri oibr oirb orbi orib
```

### Setup the example

First create a blank starter using TypeScript and install the [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro):

```bash
npx create-react-app tdd-react --template typescript
npm install @testing-library/react
```

### Jest & the testing library

This article will use Jest with the React Testing Library.  Jest lets you access the DOM and mocking functions and the React Testing Library provides tools to test and render hooks without getting into implementation details.

Next, it's a good idea to make sure everything is working.  Also, you might want to open another terminal and run the example unit test to make sure that's working also.  You can always switch between testing and running the app.  We will mainly focus on the testing for this article.  Here are the two commands:

```bash
npm run
npm test
```

Open the App.tsx file and replace the contents with this:

#### **`src/App.tsx`**

```js
import React from "react";
import "./App.css";
import { useAnagrams } from "./useAnagrams";

function App() {
  const [displayOutput, setDisplayMessage] = React.useState(false);
  const [input, setOutput] = React.useState("");
  const [anagram, updateAnagram] = useAnagrams("");

  const update = () => {
    updateAnagram(input);
    setDisplayMessage(true);
  }

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <label htmlFor="name" className="item padding">
        Enter text
      </label>
      <input
        id="name"
        type="text"
        className="padding"
        onChange={(event) => setOutput(event.currentTarget.value)}
      />
      <button onClick={() => update()} className="padding">
        Submit
      </button>
      {displayOutput && <p className="item">{anagram}</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;
```

This app now has an input, that when the submit button is pressed, will output the contents of the input.  We are using React hooks to create two values, and functions to set them:

```js
  const [displayOutput, setDisplayMessage] = React.useState(false);
  const [input, setOutput] = React.useState("");
  const [anagram, updateAnagram] = useAnagrams("");
```

We could import useState from React and use it without the dot notation there, but we can do that later when refactoring.  We could also use a better method for getting the input instead of setting it in the input onChange event.  For now we have something that will let the user enter the text they want to generate anagrams for.

Then, we have a custom hook: useAnagrams.  This file will need to be created also:

#### **`src/useAnagrams.ts` initial**

```ts
import { useState } from "react";

export function useAnagrams(input: any) {
const [anagram, setState] = useState(input);

  const updateAnagram = (input: string) => {
    const newVal = input; // <-- custom anagram logic will go here
    setState(newVal);
  }
  return [anagram, updateAnagram ];
}
```

The first version of this tutorial used only the App.tsx file to create the anagram logic, and it was tested by looking at the DOM created by that.  One point of this game is to keep things simple and focus on the TDD aspects of this game.  Therefore it seemed like a better idea to create a custom hook and just test that functionality, instead of involving the DOM in the tests.

However, this approach needs a bit of knowledge on how to test custom hooks which I will attempt to provide the fundamentals of here.

## The first test

Open the App.test.tsx file and check it out.  This is the test that was generated by create-react-app:

#### **`src/App.test.tsx` initial**

```js
import React from 'react';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import App from './App';

test('renders learn react link', () => {
  render(<App />);
  const linkElement = screen.getByText(/learn react/i);
  expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

Since we replaced the original App.tsx file with the input, this test should be failing now, which is fine.  Let's move on.

### Step one:  write a test

To get us started testing a custom hooks, let's test the default value, which should be empty.  Usually you would create a new test for useAnagrams, but since we have replaced the App.tsx to use the hook, we will just use this App test file for now.

#### **`src/useAnagrams.ts` step 1**

```tsx
import { renderHook } from "@testing-library/react";
import { useAnagrams } from "./useAnagrams";

describe("useAnagrams hook", () => {
  it("checking default state", () => {
    const { result } = renderHook(() => useAnagrams(""));
    expect(result.current.values().next().value).toBe("");
  });
});
```

This is actually a passing test, but I am showing it to demonstrate a basic custom hook test.

Now we will write a test for the kind of result that you are expecting.  If you think about the specification for the program we want to write, you can get an idea of what will prove that it is working.  Let's read the goal again:

*Write a program to generate all potential anagrams of an input string.*

So we will have a function that accepts the input string and output *all potential anagrams*.  That is all the combinations of the letters of the input.  This will be printed out on web page, which means it will be in the html.

#### "Don't boil the ocean when writing a test."

You might be tempted to test for the word "biro" which is shown in the instructions.  But a dev named Tony said during the first React dojo session "don't boil the ocean".   Instead of trying to test for a long array of anagrams (by typing in or pasting and formatting 24 strings), we can just use the smallest possible problem set, like 'ab' instead.

#### The UI DOM testing approach

I we were testing the output in the UI, we would have to fire the submit button being pressed action, and look for the output:

```jsx
test('should display anagrams of given input', () => {
  render(<App />);
  const nameInput = screen.getByLabelText(/Enter text/i);
  fireEvent.change(nameInput, {target: {value: "ab"}});
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByText(/submit/i));  
  const expectedAnagrams = [
    'ab', 'ba'
  ];
  expectedAnagrams.forEach((anagram) => {
    expect(document.body.innerHTML).toMatch(anagram);
  })
```

If you run the tests (or look at the tests that are already running), you will see something like this:

```bash
 FAIL  src/App.test.tsx
  × should display anagrams of given input (46ms)
  ● should display anagrams of given input
    expect(received).toMatch(expected)
    Expected substring: "ba"
    Received string:    "<div><div class=\"App\"><label for=\"name\" class=\"item padding\">Enter text</label><input id=\"name\" type=\"text\" class=\"padding\"><button class=\"padding\">Submit</button><p class=\"item\">ab</p></div></div>"
      12 |   ];
      13 |   expectedAnagrams.forEach((anagram) => {
    > 14 |     expect(document.body.innerHTML).toMatch(anagram);
         |                                     ^
      15 |   });
      16 | });
      17 |
      at forEach (src/App.test.tsx:14:37)
          at Array.forEach (<anonymous>)
      at Object.<anonymous> (src/App.test.tsx:13:20)
Test Suites: 1 failed, 1 total
Tests:       1 failed, 1 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        3.46s
Ran all test suites.
```

So you can see in the output there that our <p> tag doesn't have the expected output:

```html
<p class=\"item\">ab</p></div>
```

This approach is OK, but I feel like testing the DOM adds complexity that takes away from implemeting business logic.  Sometimes the component that you need to test is complicated and you get test failures not because the hook is broken, but because the interface is complicated.  For this reason, I have changed the approach first used in this article to create a custom hook to isolate the business logic and test that custom hook directly without the UI to get in the way.

#### Using the custom hooks approach

Using the custom hook approach to isolate the anagram logic is a bit different.  Modify the above test example to something like this:

#### **`src/App.test.tsx` pt 2**

```tsx
import { renderHook, act } from "@testing-library/react";
import { useAnagrams } from "./useAnagrams";

describe("useAnagrams hook", () => {
   it("checking state updates", () => {
     const { result } = renderHook(() => useAnagrams(""));
     const [ anagram, updateAnagram ] = result.current;
     expect(result.current.values().next().value).toBe("");
     act(() => {
       updateAnagram("ab");
     });
     expect(result.current.values().next().value).toBe("ab ba");
   });
});
```

This now uses the act function to make the test run closer to how React works in the browser.

The output from the failing test should look something like this:

```shell
  ● useAnagrams hook › checking state updates
    expect(received).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality
    Expected: "ab ba"
    Received: "ab"
      10 |        updateAnagram("ab");
      11 |      });
    > 12 |      expect(result.current.values().next().value).toBe("ab ba");
         |                                                   ^
      13 |    });
      14 | });
      15 |
      at Object.<anonymous> (src/App.test.tsx:12:51)
```

[This repo has the above steps implemented on the anagrams-custom-hook branch](https://github.com/timofeysie/react-tdd-dojo/tree/anagrams-custom-hook) as a starting point for this custom hooks approach.

Now we have confirmed that the test is looking for something we want.  Time to move on to the next step.

### Step two: make is pass

The simplest way to make the test pass that we're going to do may sound like cheating, but it's not.  Just by returning the expected array checks that the test is actually working properly.  After this you can move on to the refactor step.  Lets implement the simplest function we can to make our test pass.

In the App.tsx file, right after we declare the ```const [input, setOutput] = React.useState("");```, add this function:

#### **`src/useAnagrams.ts` step 2**

```ts
setState('ab ba');
```

Now the test will pass and you will probably feel like you are cheating, but you are actually confirming that your test is doing what it should be doing.  If you actually implement the anagram code now, this test will still pass.

You could also to do a Google search for a JavaScript anagram generator, and just paste that in to make the test pass in an actual working way.  That's also valid.  I think however there is value to "testing the test".  We might somehow get the test to pass when it should be failing by using code we don't understand, and that would be bad.

However, since it's time for the next step, we could try something like that when refactoring the solution.

### Step three: refactor

Here is a basic function that will do a more realistic job for us.  Change the anagrams function to look like this:

#### **`src/useAnagrams.ts` step 3**

```js
  const anagrams = (input: string): string => {
    const newVal = input.split("")
      .map((character: string, index: number) => {
        const head = word.slice(0, index);
        const tail = word.substring(index + 1);
        const result: string[] = [];
        for (let nextCharInTail of head) {
          result.push(character + nextCharInTail);
        }
        for (let nextCharInTail of tail) {
          result.push(character + nextCharInTail);
        }
        return result;
      })
      .join(" ");
  };
  setState(newVal)
```

Now if you run the tests, it passes!  But does the app do what we want it to do yet?  Run the app with the command ```npm start``` and test it out.

If you enter "ab", you will see the expected results there returned by the function above.  But if you enter the text from the instructions, "biro" you will see this output:

```txt
bi,br,bo ib,ir,io rb,ri,ro ob,oi,or
```

So, yeah, we have a problem.  But never fear, TDD is here!  What do we do?  Back to step 1.  We write a failing test.  Let's do that now.

### Step one again

Open the test file and create a new test for what we want to see.  Now it's time to make a meaningful test.

```js
  it("checking state updates for four letter inputs", () => {
    const { result } = renderHook(() => useAnagrams(""));
    const [anagram, updateAnagram] = result.current;
    expect(result.current.values().next().value).toBe("");
    const expectedAnagrams = [
    "biro", "bior", "brio", "broi", "boir", "bori",
    "ibro", "ibor", "irbo", "irob", "iobr", "iorb",
    "rbio", "rboi", "ribo", "riob", "roib", "robi",
    "obir", "obri", "oibr", "oirb", "orbi", "orib",
  ];
    act(() => {
      updateAnagram("biro");
    });
    expect(result.current.values().next().value).toBe(expectedAnagrams);
  });
```

Yes, someone had to go through all the variations of biro to make that expected anagrams array.  Sometimes that's what you have to do.  I wouldn't want to do that for longer words, but it all depends on the kind of function you're writing.

You can see the above step in the anagrams-custom-hook-meaningful-test branch of the [Github repo](https://github.com/timofeysie/react-tdd-dojo) from above.

This test will fail in the same way our manual test of the function failed.  The output will say something like this:

```shell
  ● useAnagrams hook › checking state updates for four letter inputs
    expect(received).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality
    Expected: ["biro", "bior", "brio", "broi", "boir", "bori", "ibro", "ibor", "irbo", "irob", "iobr", "iorb", "rbio", "rboi", "ribo", "riob", "roib", "robi", "obir", "obri", "oibr", "oirb", "orbi", "orib"]
    Received: "bi,br,bo ib,ir,io rb,ri,ro ob,oi,or"
```

As you can see, our anagrams implementation is only handling two letters correctly.  Time to refactor that to make the test green again.

I wont go into an actual real life solution here.  I'm sure you could find a better function than the one we used above.  Or you could take the challenge and fix the function yourself.  If you do, use the hashtag #TDDReactAnagram and the link below on Twitter to let me know how it goes!

## Summary

It's fun to do pair programming or "mobbing" with larger groups online to solve something like this.  

TDD is a big field with many opinions.  Red-green-refactor provides a great framework which puts this powerful technique to good use.  Other benefits include learning to express your ideas about coding and testing better.
