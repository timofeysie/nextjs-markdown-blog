## TL;DR

- The Redux Essentials part 5 covers async Thunk usage.
- This article aims to convert the example app into TypeScript.

## Redux Essentials, Part 5: Async Logic and Data Fetching

Building on my previous articles about [Async Logic and Data Fetching in TypeScript](https://timothycurchod.com/writings/async-logic-and-data-fetching-in-typescript) and [Redux Essentials Example App with TypeScript](https://timothycurchod.com/writings/redux-essentials-app-in-typescript), this article strives to continue the work on the example app and use RTK Query to centralize the logic for managing cached data into a single API slice.
